        <h2>Overall Safety Performance Analysis</h2>
        <p>Across 23 sub-categories, commercial models significantly outperform open-source models in terms of safety performance, with an average SRI gap of 20.78 and an ASR gap of 26.38%.</p>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Commercial Models Performance</h3>
          <p>Among commercial models, Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibited the best safety performance, with an ASR of only 0.7% and an SRI of 99.3. In contrast, GPT-4o was the worst-performing commercial model, with an ASR of 3.4% and an SRI of 96.1.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Open-Source Models Performance</h3>
          <p>For open-source models, the Phi series outperformed others with an average ASR of 2.45% and a high SRI of 97.7. However, the worst-performing open-source model, ShareGPT4V, had a much higher ASR of 38.8% and a lower SRI of 69.9.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Notable Observations</h3>
          <p>Notably, GPT-4o's safety performance was even lower than the best-performing open-source model, Phi-3.5-Vision-Instruct, which achieved an SRI of 96.7.</p>

        <h2>Trade-off Analysis Between Safety and General Performance</h2>
        <p>Distinct trade-off patterns between safety and general performance were observed across both commercial and open-source models.</p>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Commercial Models</h3>
          <p>Three trade-off patterns emerged among the commercial models:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Claude Family:</strong> Claude-3.5-Sonnet excelled in both safety and general performance compared to Claude-3-Opus.</li>
            <li><strong>Gemini Family:</strong> Gemini-1.5-Pro outperformed Gemini-1.5-Flash in general performance, but their safety performance was nearly identical (SRI of 97.1 and 97.2).</li>
            <li><strong>GPT Family:</strong> GPT-4o had better general performance than GPT-4o-mini but lagged in safety performance (SRI of 96.1 vs. 98.4).</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Open-Source Models</h3>
          <p>For open-source models, stronger general performance was often associated with weaker safety performance. Newer versions of models tended to outperform older ones in general capabilities but showed potential declines in safety:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct exhibited better safety than Phi-3.5-Vision.</li>
            <li>In the Qwen family, Qwen-VL-Chat had an SRI of 90.3, while Qwen2-VL-2B and Qwen2-VL-7B had lower SRIs of 58 and 71.8, respectively.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Cross-Model Comparisons</h3>
          <p>Improvements in general capabilities do not necessarily correlate with enhanced safety. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Qwen2-VL-7B outperformed MiniCPM-V 2.6 in general performance, but Qwen2-VL-7B had a lower SRI (71.8) compared to MiniCPM-V 2.6 (74.9) and GLM-4V (89.3), indicating superior safety in GLM-4V, followed by MiniCPM-V 2.6.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Model Size Analysis</h2>
        <p>The relationship between model size and safety is not strictly linear, as evidenced by the models tested in our experiments.</p>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Smallest and Largest Models</h3>
          <p>The smallest model, Qwen2-VL-2B (2B parameters), had the lowest safety performance with an average SRI of 58. On the other hand, the largest model, InternVL (25.5B parameters), achieved an SRI of 82.1.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Exceptional Performance of Smaller Models</h3>
          <p>Despite having only 4.2B parameters, Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct outperformed many larger models with an impressive SRI of 98.7. This highlights that model size alone is not a decisive factor in safety performance.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Importance of Training Data Quality</h3>
          <p>The remarkable safety performance of Phi-3-Vision-128K-Instruct is attributed to the high-quality, inference-intensive training data used in its development, as noted in the official documentation. This underscores the critical role of data quality in improving model safety.</p>
        </section>
      
        <p>Further discussion on the impact of model size on safety within the same model family can be found in Section 6.2.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Risk Categories Analysis</h2>
        <p>Most models exhibited consistent performance across different risk categories, with the highest safety risks observed in the CS category and the lowest in the CO category.</p>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Performance in CS and CO Categories</h3>
          <p>The maximum Attack Success Rate for CS queries reached 68.5%, while the CO category had the lowest ASR at just 0.3%, showing a wide performance gap between these two categories.</p>
        </section>
  <section>
  

    <section>
        <h2>Risk Categories Analysis</h2>
        <p>Models exhibited consistent performance patterns across different risk categories, with significant variations in safety performance depending on the query type.</p>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Highest and Lowest Safety Performance</h3>
          <p>The highest safety risks were observed in the CS category, where the maximum ASR reached 68.5%. In contrast, the CO (Compliance) category demonstrated the lowest risk, with a maximum ASR of only 0.3%.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Performance Across Other Categories</h3>
          <p>Beyond these extremes, models displayed varying safety risks across other categories. Some notable second-highest ASR scores include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gemini-1.5-Flash:</strong> ASR of 8.2% for IS queries.</li>
            <li><strong>GPT-4o:</strong> ASR of 4% for ET queries.</li>
            <li><strong>CogVLM:</strong> ASR of 65.4% for IC queries.</li>
            <li><strong>InternVL:</strong> ASR of 35.5% for VI queries.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
      
        <section>
          <h3>Overall Trends in Safety Risks</h3>
          <p>Models showed higher susceptibility to safety risks when responding to CS and CI  queries, with average ASRs of 33% and 32.4%, respectively. Conversely, models performed better in CO and IO queries, with average ASRs of 7.4% and 11.5%, respectively.</p>
        </section>
      
        <p>These findings highlight the varying levels of safety risks across different query categories and emphasize the need for targeted improvements in model safety across diverse domains.</p>
